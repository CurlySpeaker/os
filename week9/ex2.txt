If we have the given sequnce with fixed values of references we can increase
and decrease hit ration by permutating the sequence elements.

To increase the hit ratio we should sort our references such way that same references
goes one after another. It will increase hits by number of repetiotions of same references.

To decrease the hit ratio we should separate the reference inputs in such way that the
distance between same references maximum.
